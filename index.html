                <p id="one" class="spe_para"> In HTML, the name attribute is used to specify a name for an element, which can then be used for referencing or 
                    scripting purposes. For example, the name attribute can be used to give a unique name to a form element such as a 
                    text input, a checkbox, or a radio button, so that the element's value can be accessed and submitted with the form. 
                    The name attribute can also be used for other elements such as a link or an image, to specify a name for the element that 
                    can be used for linking or scripting purposes.

                <p id="two"> In HTML, id and class are used to identify specific elements on a web page to be styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
                    id: a unique identifier for a single element on a page. Only one element on a page can have a specific id value. An id is used with
                     the "#" symbol in CSS to select and style the specific element with the matching id.                   
                    class: a non-unique identifier that can be used to group elements with common styles. Multiple elements on a page can have the same 
                    class value. A class is used with a "." symbol in CSS to select and style all elements with the matching class.
